# NeurIPS2023-LogSpecT
The core codes of the paper 'LogSpecT: Feasible Graph Learning Model from Stationary Signals with Recovery Guarantees' are provided here.
'algorithms' file includes the LADMM algorithm designed for LogSpecT model. The outputs of the function ladmm are the learned graph, the primal and dual residuals, the rho sequence.
'generator' file includes the signal generator and graph generator functions.
pygsp(https://pygsp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package is needed to run the file.
